**`[June, 2023]`** add [S14 Clock](s14clock) project

**`[July, 2018]`** creation of this launch page which should eventually host all of my published projects


### Microcontroller Projects since 2010, mostly TI MSP430 devices



I am consolidating all of my projects in github and is moving all the project pages here. Some of these projects are quite old and I am not able to support them anymore. Source codes are available for your experimentation and I cannot guarantee usability and success of any of my projects.

:h2 SimpleAvr Projects

R([July, 2018]) creation of this launch page which should eventually host all of my published projects

:h3 Microcontroller Projects since 2010, mostly TI MSP430 devices

I am consolidating all of my projects in github and is moving all the project pages here. Some of these projects are quite old and I am not able to support them anymore. Source codes are available for your experimentation and I cannot guarantee usability and success of any of my projects.

In no particular order
